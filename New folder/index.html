              <h2>CELL</h2>
              <p>
                In filler episodes of the anime, Cell makes numerous cameo
                appearances, usually as comic relief. Cell tries absorbing two
                siblings, but is prevented from doing so by Krillin, giving chase
                to the three and nearly killing Krillin before he notices Piccolo
                and Tien Shinhan on the way and escapes.
